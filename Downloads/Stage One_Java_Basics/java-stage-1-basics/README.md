Stage 1 – Java Basics

This folder contains my very first Java exercises.
The goal is to get comfortable with:

Writing and compiling simple Java classes

Using variables, operators, and basic input/output

Practising control flow (if/else, loops)

Projects

Hello.java	Prints “Hello, World!” – first Java program.
Calculator.java + Main.java	Simple 2-number calculator with add, subtract, multiply, divide methods.
